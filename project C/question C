Multithreaded Sorting Application: Write a multithreaded sorting program that works as 
follows: A list of integers is divided into two smaller lists of equal size. Two separate 
threads (which we will term sorting threads) sort each sublist using a sorting algorithm 
of your choice. The two sublists are then merged by a third thread—a merging thread —
which merges the two sublists into a single sorted list. 
Because global data are shared across all threads, perhaps the easiest way to set up the data 
is to create a global array. Each sorting thread will work on one half of this array. A second 
global array of the same size as the unsorted integer array will also be established. The 
merging thread will then merge the two sublists into this second array. Graphically, this 
program is structured as in Figure 1. 
This programming project will require passing parameters to each of the sorting threads. In 
particular, it will be necessary to identify the starting index from which each thread is to 
begin sorting. The parent thread will output the sorted array once all sorting threads have 
exited.
